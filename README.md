# asm3-picoCTF-python
simple script that solves asm3~picoCTF. 

u should've downloaded the needed packages i.e gcc for 32 bit , libc6-dev-i386 etc. make sure to solve dependency problems for gcc before running the script
the script is not to cheat ur way into gaining some invaluable points in picoCTF. is for education purposes and general use. 
Enjoy!!
